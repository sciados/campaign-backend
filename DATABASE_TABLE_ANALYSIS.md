## Product Image Scraper Data Flow

```
1. User creates campaign â†’ campaigns table
2. Intelligence analyzes URL â†’ intelligence_core table
3. Scraper extracts images â†’ scraped_images table
4. Images stored in R2 â†’ user_storage_usage updated
5. Content generated â†’ generated_content table
6. Performance tracked â†’ performance_metrics table
```

## `scraped_images` Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE scraped_images (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    -- Storage locations
    r2_path VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    cdn_url VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    original_url VARCHAR,

    -- Image properties
    width INTEGER NOT NULL,
    height INTEGER NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    format VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,

    -- Metadata
    alt_text TEXT,
    context TEXT,
    quality_score FLOAT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0,

    -- Classification flags
    is_hero BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL,
    is_product BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL,
    is_lifestyle BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL,

    -- Usage tracking
    times_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
    last_used_at TIMESTAMP,

    -- Additional metadata
    metadata JSONB,

    -- Timestamps
    scraped_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_images_campaign ON scraped_images(campaign_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_images_user ON scraped_images(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_images_quality ON scraped_images(quality_score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_images_campaign_type ON scraped_images(campaign_id, is_hero, is_product);
```

## Relationships

### scraped_images â†’ campaigns
- **Foreign Key:** `campaign_id` â†’ `campaigns.id`
- **Cascade:** ON DELETE CASCADE (delete images when campaign deleted)

### scraped_images â†’ users
- **Foreign Key:** `user_id` â†’ `users.id`
- **Cascade:** ON DELETE CASCADE (delete images when user deleted)

### Data Integrity
- Images are automatically cleaned up when campaigns are deleted
- Orphaned images prevented by foreign key constraints
- Quality scoring ensures only high-quality images are used

---

## Storage Tracking

When images are scraped:
1. File saved to Cloudflare R2 at `campaigns/{id}/scraped-images/`
2. CDN URL generated for fast access
3. Row inserted into `scraped_images` table
4. `user_storage_usage` updated with file size
5. Campaign analytics updated

---

## Query Examples

### Get all scraped images for a campaign:
```sql
SELECT * FROM scraped_images
WHERE campaign_id = 'abc-123'
ORDER BY quality_score DESC;
```

### Get hero images only:
```sql
SELECT * FROM scraped_images
WHERE campaign_id = 'abc-123'
AND is_hero = TRUE
ORDER BY quality_score DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Get images by type:
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_hero) as hero_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_product) as product_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_lifestyle) as lifestyle_count,
    AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM scraped_images
WHERE campaign_id = 'abc-123';
```

### Track most used images:
```sql
SELECT
    cdn_url,
    quality_score,
    times_used,
    last_used_at
FROM scraped_images
WHERE campaign_id = 'abc-123'
ORDER BY times_used DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
