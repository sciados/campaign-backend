Campaign Workflow Errors

Path should be:

Step 1 - Create Camapign - Complete Form:
    a - add title
    b - add description
    c - include Salespage url
    d - include keywords
    e - etc

Step 2 - Auto Analyze Salespage
    a - Gather data from Salespage with aid of keywords
    b - Pass data to Enhancers and enhance intelligence
    c - Save enhanced intelligence to the database

Step 3 - Create Content By Selecting from available options:
    a - Email Series/Sequence
    b - Ad Copy
    c - Blog Posts
    d - Images
    e - slideshow style videos
    f - videos
    g - Social Media Posts
    h - etc

Routes Rules:
If only Step One is completed then when the User returns and selects the Campaign the the User is automatically moved to Step Two
If Step One & Step Two have been completed then the User will be automatically moved to Step 3 to create new content

There appears to be an error in the routes file which is directing the User to the old deprecated 4 step workflow that existed before the new 3 step Workflow was put in place. This needs correcting.
