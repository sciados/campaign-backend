## Campaign Quota Management System

### Per-Campaign Content Buckets
```python
class CampaignQuota:
    def __init__(self, tier: UserTier):
        self.emails = tier.emails_per_campaign
        self.social_posts = tier.social_per_campaign
        self.blog_articles = tier.blogs_per_campaign
        self.ad_copy = tier.ads_per_campaign
        self.images = tier.images_per_campaign
        self.slideshow_videos = tier.slideshow_per_campaign
        self.premium_videos = tier.premium_per_campaign

    def can_generate_content(self, content_type: str) -> bool:
        return getattr(self, content_type) > 0

    def consume_quota(self, content_type: str, amount: int = 1):
        current = getattr(self, content_type)
        setattr(self, content_type, max(0, current - amount))
```

### Cross-Campaign Resource Sharing
```python
class UserQuotaManager:
    def redistribute_quota(self, from_campaign: str, to_campaign: str,
                          content_type: str, amount: int):
        """Allow users to move unused quota between campaigns"""
        if self.campaigns[from_campaign].can_transfer(content_type, amount):
            self.campaigns[from_campaign].consume_quota(content_type, amount)
            self.campaigns[to_campaign].add_quota(content_type, amount)
            return True
        return False
```

## Video Upgrade Economics

### Slideshow Video Baseline (Included)
- **Cost to generate**: $0.20
- **User value**: High volume content creation
- **Margin per video**: Break-even (covered by base subscription)

### Premium AI Video Upgrades
- **Cost to generate**: $0.75
- **Upgrade price**: $1.99-2.99
- **Margin per upgrade**: $1.24-2.24 (62-75% margin)

### Bulk Upgrade Incentives
- **5-video pack**: $12.99 (vs $14.95 individual) - 13% discount
- **10-video pack**: $19.99 (vs $24.90 individual) - 20% discount
- **Encourages higher spending** while providing user value

## User Experience Workflow

### Campaign Creation Flow
1. **Select campaign type** (product launch, seasonal, ongoing)
2. **View content allocation** for that campaign
3. **Choose video strategy** (slideshow default + premium upgrades)
4. **Generate content** within campaign context
5. **Upgrade videos** as needed during campaign

### Smart Recommendations
```typescript
interface VideoRecommendation {
    campaign_goal: string;
    recommended_mix: {
        slideshow_videos: number;
        premium_videos: number;
    };
    upgrade_suggestions: {
        content_type: string;
        recommended_upgrade: boolean;
        reason: string;
    }[];
}
```

### Upgrade Decision Points
- **After slideshow generation**: "Upgrade to premium AI video? +$2.99"
- **Campaign planning**: "This campaign would benefit from 3 premium videos for key content"
- **Performance analytics**: "Premium videos in similar campaigns had 34% higher engagement"

## Cost Control Mechanisms

### Campaign-Level Budgeting
```python
class CampaignBudget:
    def __init__(self, base_allowance: float, upgrade_limit: float):
        self.base_content_value = base_allowance  # Included in subscription
        self.upgrade_budget = upgrade_limit       # Additional spending allowed
        self.spent_upgrades = 0.0

    def can_afford_upgrade(self, upgrade_cost: float) -> bool:
        return (self.spent_upgrades + upgrade_cost) <= self.upgrade_budget
```

### Predictive Cost Management
- **Usage alerts** at 75% of campaign quota
- **Upgrade recommendations** based on campaign performance
- **Cross-campaign optimization** suggestions
- **Monthly spend forecasting** based on current usage

## Revenue Optimization Strategies

### Upgrade Conversion Tactics
1. **Quality comparison previews**: Show slideshow vs premium video samples
2. **Performance data**: "Premium videos average 2.3x higher engagement"
3. **Campaign-specific recommendations**: AI suggests optimal video mix
4. **Bulk upgrade incentives**: Progressive discounts for volume

### Retention Strategies
1. **Rollover unused quota**: Up to 25% to next month
2. **Campaign extensions**: Extend active campaigns beyond monthly limit
3. **Seasonal adjustments**: Bonus quota during high-activity periods
4. **Loyalty rewards**: Accumulated upgrade credits for long-term users

## Analytics & Insights

### Campaign Performance Tracking
```python
class CampaignAnalytics:
    def analyze_content_performance(self, campaign_id: str) -> CampaignInsights:
        return {
            "slideshow_engagement": self.get_slideshow_metrics(campaign_id),
            "premium_video_roi": self.calculate_premium_roi(campaign_id),
            "optimal_content_mix": self.suggest_content_allocation(campaign_id),
            "upgrade_effectiveness": self.measure_upgrade_impact(campaign_id)
        }
