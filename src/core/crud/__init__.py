"""
# In any service file:
from src.core.crud import campaign_crud, intelligence_crud

# In campaign service:
async def get_user_campaigns(db: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID, company_id: UUID):

    return await intelligence_crud.get_campaign_intelligence(
        db=db, 
        campaign_id=campaign_id
    )

# Generic CRUD operations:
async def get_campaign_by_id(db: AsyncSession, campaign_id: UUID):
    return await campaign_crud.get(db=db, id=campaign_id)

# Search and filtering:
async def search_campaigns(db: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID, search_term: str):

        db=db,
        user_id=user_id,

# Statistics and analytics:
async def get_campaign_stats(db: AsyncSession, user_id: UUID):
    return await campaign_crud.get_campaign_stats(
        db=db,
        user_id=user_id

# ðŸ”§ Migration Guide for Services:

BEFORE (problematic async patterns):

# ðŸš€ Next Steps:
"""
1. Replace direct database queries with CRUD methods
2. Remove ChunkedIteratorResult issues by using proven async patterns
3. Simplify service layer code with consistent database access
4. Add proper error handling and logging through CRUD layer
5. Maintain existing API contracts while improving reliability
