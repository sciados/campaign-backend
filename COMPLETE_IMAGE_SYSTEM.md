## Feature Breakdown

### 1. Generic Scene Generation

**Philosophy:** Generate backgrounds that work for ANY product

**Scene Types:**
```yaml
product_hero:
  description: "Studio backdrop with empty pedestal"
  use_for: "Product photography style shots"
  reusability: "Bottles, boxes, books, courses, apps"

lifestyle:
  description: "Person in natural setting with product space"
  use_for: "Real-world usage scenarios"
  reusability: "Hand-held products, daily routines"

comparison:
  description: "Before/after split-screen framework"
  use_for: "Transformation visuals"
  reusability: "Any product showing results"

infographic:
  description: "Abstract composition with product areas"
  use_for: "Feature highlights, benefits"
  reusability: "Educational content, specs"

social_post:
  description: "Eye-catching background for social"
  use_for: "Shareable graphics"
  reusability: "Instagram, Facebook, Twitter posts"
```

**Intelligence Integration:**
- Target audience informs scene mood
- Brand personality affects lighting/style
- Pain points guide environment selection
- Desire states influence composition

**Example Prompts:**
```
Health/Wellness Scene:
"Professional studio backdrop with perfect lighting,
clean minimalist background for product placement,
wellness aesthetic with natural elements, empty
pedestal ready for product, NO PRODUCTS in scene"

Success/Wealth Scene:
"Modern office desk environment, successful
entrepreneur workspace, empty focal area perfect
for product placement, professional achievement
atmosphere, NO PRODUCTS in frame"
```

### 2. Automatic Text Removal

**Why It's Necessary:**
- AI models often add gibberish text to products
- Text is unreadable and unprofessional
- Cleaning ensures pristine backgrounds

**Process:**
```python
1. Generate scene with AI
2. Detect any accidental text/artifacts
3. Use Stability AI inpainting to remove
4. Return clean, pristine background
5. Ready for mockup overlay
```

**Cost:** ~$0.01 per scene
**Quality:** Professional-grade cleanliness

### 3. Image Variation Generation

**Purpose:** Create infinite unique versions from one successful scene

**Variation Strength Levels:**
```
Subtle (0.1-0.3):
  - Minor lighting adjustments
  - Slight color variations
  - Same composition
  - Use for: Very similar but not identical

Moderate (0.4-0.6):
  - Noticeable differences
  - Some composition changes
  - Different mood/tone
  - Use for: Distinct but related scenes

Strong (0.7-0.9):
  - Significant changes
  - Major composition differences
  - Very different atmosphere
  - Use for: New scenes inspired by original
```

**Providers & Pricing:**
```yaml
DALL-E Variations:
  quality: "Best"
  speed: "Moderate"

## Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Health Supplement Campaign

**Step 1: Generate Scene**
```
Input: "Generate lifestyle image for health supplement"
AI creates: Person in wellness setting, hands visible,
            empty space ready for bottle
Cost: $0.05
```

**Step 2: Clean Scene**
```
Stability AI removes any artifacts
Cost: $0.01
Result: Pristine wellness lifestyle scene
```

**Step 3A: Create 5 Variations**
```
variation_strength: 0.3 (subtle)
Results: 5 unique but similar wellness scenes
Cost: 5 × $0.02 = $0.10 (DALL-E)
```

**Step 3B: Add Product to Each Variation**
```
PRO user adds HepatoBurn bottle mockup to each scene
Results: 5 unique marketing images for same product
Cost: 5 × $0.10 = $0.50
Total for 5 unique images: $0.66
```

**Reusability:**
```
Same 5 scenes + different supplement = 5 new images
Cost: 5 × $0.10 = $0.50 (no scene regeneration)
```

### Example 2: Online Course Campaign

**Step 1: Generate Scene**
```
Input: "Generate success-themed desk background"
AI creates: Professional desk setup, laptop visible,
            empty screen area for course display
Cost: $0.05
```

**Step 2: Clean Scene**
```
Remove artifacts
Cost: $0.01
```

**Step 3: Scale Across Products**
```
Add course mockup #1 → Image 1
Add course mockup #2 → Image 2
Add eBook mockup → Image 3
Add workbook mockup → Image 4
Add certification mockup → Image 5

ONE scene → 5 different product images
Cost: 5 × $0.10 = $0.50
```

### Example 3: Testing Scene Variations

**Goal:** Find best-performing scene for health supplement

**Process:**
```
1. Generate wellness lifestyle scene → $0.05
2. Clean scene → $0.01
3. Create 10 variations (subtle) → 10 × $0.003 = $0.03 (Flux)
4. Add HepatoBurn mockup to each → 10 × $0.10 = $1.00
5. Run A/B test on all 10 variations
6. Find winner → Use for all future campaigns

Total cost: $1.09 to find best scene
Reuse winner across 100+ products with different mockups
```

## Cost Efficiency Analysis

### Old Approach (Product-Specific Images)
```
Generate image with Product A → $0.05
Generate image with Product B → $0.05
Generate image with Product C → $0.05
...
100 products × $0.05 = $5.00
```

### New Approach (Generic Scenes + Mockups)
```
Generate scene once → $0.05
Clean scene → $0.01
Add Product A mockup → $0.10
Add Product B mockup → $0.10
Add Product C mockup → $0.10
...
Scene cost: $0.06 (one-time)
Mockup cost: 100 × $0.10 = $10.00
Total: $10.06

BUT: With variations for diversity:
Generate 10 scene variations → 10 × $0.003 = $0.03
10 unique scenes for 100 products → better diversity
Actual per-image cost: $0.106 per unique image
```

### Scaling Benefits
```
1 product:    $0.16 per image
10 products:  $0.016 per image
100 products: $0.0016 per image
1000 products: $0.00016 per image

= Virtually FREE at scale
```

## Best Practices

### For Scene Generation
```
✅ DO:
- Generate generic backgrounds without products
- Use intelligence data for mood/audience
- Request clean, empty focal areas
- Specify "no products, no text"

❌ DON'T:
- Include specific product names in prompts
- Request text or labels
- Generate product-specific details
```

### For Variations
```
✅ DO:
- Start with subtle variations (0.2-0.3)
- Test multiple variations for A/B testing
- Use Flux for quick iterations
- Use DALL-E for final high-quality versions

❌ DON'T:
- Use very strong variations (>0.7) if you want consistency
- Skip testing different strengths
- Forget to track which variations perform best
```

### For Mockups
```
✅ DO:
- Use cleaned scenes as base
- Choose templates matching product type
- Test mockup on scene before batch generation
- Reuse successful scene + mockup combinations

❌ DON'T:
- Add mockups to uncleaned scenes
- Use same mockup template for all products
- Forget to check mockup quality before using
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Track These Metrics
```
Scenes Generated: Track total unique scenes
Scene Reuse Rate: Times each scene used with mockups
Variation Success: Which variations perform best
Mockup Usage: Most popular templates
Cost Per Campaign: Total image generation costs
```

### Optimization Opportunities
```
1. Identify top 10 performing scenes
2. Create 20 variations of each
3. Build library of 200 proven scenes
4. Reduce scene generation by 90%
5. Focus budget on mockup diversity
```

## Future Enhancements
